# Heart disease risk prediction
The project aims to predict the risk of heart disease based on features like cholesterol, age and blood pressure. Three machine learning models were built using the following algorithms :
1. Logistic regression
2. Random forest
3. Decision tree

The following steps were implemented :
1. Importing the dataset
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Data preprocessing
4. Model building
5. Model evaluation

Result: A decision tree model demonstrated the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.48%, precision of 0.95, recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.89
